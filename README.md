# Python
A collection of programs I've written in Python. 

1. My Taco Pet! 
petclass.py: contains the pet class. 
petdesign.py: contains the main function to run the game. 
 Taco is a pet that you can feed, and play a game with it to increase its happiness meter. It will get hungrier every time you play a game with it, and if it's too hungry, you can't play the game with it.
 
 The game starts, and you guess whether Taco will look at the left or the right. Guess right, and you win!
